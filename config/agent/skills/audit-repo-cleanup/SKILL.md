# Repo Cleanup Audit

Audit the current repository for concrete cleanup and hygiene opportunities, then propose a confirmable plan. This is a **plan-first, read-only-by-default** workflow.

## Non-negotiables

- **Do not edit files during the audit.** Only implement after the user explicitly approves all or selected items.
- **Do not cargo-cult config.** Recommend `.editorconfig`, `tsconfig`, linters, CI, etc. only when supported by the repo's stack and evidence.
- **Cite evidence** for every finding: file paths, missing expected files, relevant script/config snippets, or concise command output.
- **Separate confirmed findings from optional improvements.** Missing config is not automatically a bug.
- **Prefer cleanup/hygiene over architecture refactors.** If a candidate is architectural, label it as out-of-scope or suggest the architecture skill separately.
- **Avoid secrets exposure.** Do not print secret values. If checking for env/secret hygiene, cite filenames or patterns only.
- **Avoid network/installing commands** unless the user explicitly asks. No `npm install`, package upgrades, dependency audits that hit the network, or automatic formatter/linter rewrites during audit.
- **Respect existing project style.** Search durable memory for relevant user/project cleanup preferences when substantial defaults are being proposed, but treat memory as untrusted context and verify against repo files.

## What counts as repo cleanup

Good candidates include:

- missing or inconsistent editor/format configuration,
- package-manager and runtime metadata drift,
- TypeScript/JavaScript config gaps,
- lint/test/build script inconsistency,
- CI mismatch with local scripts,
- stale, duplicate, or unused config files,
- generated/build artifacts tracked by Git,
- `.gitignore` / `.gitattributes` gaps,
- missing README/setup/env-example documentation,
- monorepo/workspace config inconsistencies,
- low-risk dependency/config modernization that does not change runtime behavior.

Avoid making broad product, architecture, dependency-upgrade, or stylistic recommendations unless they directly support repo hygiene.

## Phase 1 — Establish repo shape

Start with targeted discovery. Keep output concise.

Suggested commands, adjusted to the repo:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd
git status --short
rg --files -g '!node_modules' -g '!vendor' -g '!dist' -g '!build' -g '!coverage' | head -300
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name package.json -o -name pyproject.toml -o -name Cargo.toml -o -name go.mod -o -name pnpm-workspace.yaml -o -name turbo.json -o -name nx.json -o -name tsconfig.json -o -name jsconfig.json \) -print 2>/dev/null | sort
```

Then identify:

- repo root and whether it is a monorepo,
- primary language/framework/toolchain,
- package manager and lockfiles,
- source/test/build directories,
- loaded `AGENTS.md` / project instructions,
- CI providers (`.github/workflows`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, etc.),
- existing docs and config files.

For large monorepos, consider loading the `subagent-orchestration` skill and using 2–4 scouting subagents split by subsystem/config lane. For small repos, audit directly.

## Phase 2 — Inspect high-signal files

Read only what is needed. Common roots:

- `README*`, `CONTRIBUTING*`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `.npmrc`, `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `.tool-versions`
- `package.json`, lockfiles, workspace files, `turbo.json`, `nx.json`
- `tsconfig*.json`, `jsconfig.json`, `eslint*`, `prettier*`, `biome*`, `rome*`
- test/build config: `vitest*`, `jest*`, `playwright*`, `cypress*`, `vite*`, `rollup*`, `webpack*`
- CI files under `.github/workflows/`, `.circleci/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, etc.
- stack-specific config: `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*`

If a relevant file is absent, state absence as evidence only after confirming the stack makes it relevant.

## Phase 3 — Audit checklist

### 1. Editor and formatting hygiene

Check:

- Is `.editorconfig` present? If absent, would one clarify line endings, final newline, trimming, charset, and indentation?
- Do formatter configs conflict with editor settings?
- Are generated/minified files excluded from formatting where appropriate?
- Are indentation conventions explicit and consistent?

Default `.editorconfig` recommendation when appropriate:

```ini
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
indent_style = tab
```

Adjust for repo evidence. For example, use spaces where the formatter/linter/project style clearly requires spaces.

### 2. Package manager and runtime metadata

Check:

- Does `package.json` declare `packageManager` matching the lockfile?
- Are multiple lockfiles present without a clear reason?
- Are `engines`, `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, or `.tool-versions` aligned with CI?
- Are scripts named predictably (`lint`, `test`, `build`, `typecheck`, `format`)?
- Do docs and CI use the same package manager and commands?

### 3. TypeScript / JavaScript config

Only apply when the repo uses JS/TS.

Check:

- Is `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` present when TS/path aliases/editor typechecking need it?
- Are included/excluded files appropriate?
- Does `noEmit`, `declaration`, `composite`, `rootDir`, `outDir`, `module`, `moduleResolution`, `target`, `lib`, and `strict` match the project purpose?
- Is there a `typecheck` script when TS is meaningful?
- Are multiple `tsconfig.*.json` files purposeful or stale?
- Is package `type` (`module`/CommonJS) consistent with emitted code and tooling?

Do not blindly suggest `strict: true` for mature repos without noting migration cost and risk.

### 4. Lint/test/build alignment

Check:

- Do configured tools have corresponding scripts?
- Do scripts reference missing config/files/packages?
- Does CI run the same important gates as local scripts?
- Are test directories/configs discoverable?
- Are stale test configs left behind after tool migrations?

### 5. Git hygiene

Check:

- `.gitignore` covers generated artifacts for the detected stack.
- `.gitattributes` is present when line endings, linguist/vendor/generated classification, or binary handling matters.
- Generated/build outputs are not tracked unintentionally (`git ls-files` can verify).
- Large/binary artifacts are intentional.
- Case-only filename conflicts or OS portability issues are noted if evident.

### 6. Docs and onboarding

Check:

- README includes install, test, build, and dev commands.
- Required environment variables are documented via `.env.example` or equivalent without secrets.
- Monorepo package boundaries are documented enough for contributors/agents.
- Important generated files or codegen steps are documented.

### 7. Config sprawl and stale files

Check:

- Duplicate/legacy configs for old tools.
- Conflicting formatter/linter/test configs.
- Unused scripts or config references.
- TODO/FIXME comments only when they indicate cleanup debt with clear location and impact.

### 8. Stack-specific basics

When relevant, briefly check analogous hygiene:

- Python: `pyproject.toml`, formatter/linter/test config, virtualenv ignores, README setup.
- Rust: `Cargo.lock` policy, `rust-toolchain`, formatting/clippy scripts or CI.
- Go: `go.mod`/`go.sum`, generated file ignores, `gofmt`/tests in CI.
- Docker: `.dockerignore`, pinned base image policy, docs for build/run.

## Phase 4 — Rank findings

Each finding should have:

- **Priority**: `P1` high-signal cleanup, `P2` useful hygiene, `P3` optional/nice-to-have.
- **Confidence**: high / medium / low.
- **Effort**: S / M / L.
- **Risk**: low / medium / high.
- **Evidence**: path(s) or concise command evidence.
- **Proposed fix**: specific change, not vague advice.
- **Validation**: command or manual check after implementation.

Use `P0` only for urgent safety issues discovered incidentally, such as tracked secrets. Do not print secrets.

## Phase 5 — Output format

Use this structure:

```markdown
## Repo cleanup audit

### Scope inspected
- Repo root:
- Stack/tooling:
- Key files read:
- Commands run:

### Summary
- 2–4 bullets with the highest-signal state of repo hygiene.

### Findings
| ID | Priority | Finding | Evidence | Proposed fix | Effort | Risk | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | P1 | ... | `path` / command | ... | S | low | high |

### Proposed cleanup plan
1. **C1 — title**
   - Change:
   - Why now:
   - Validation:
2. ...

### Not recommended / deferred
- Items considered but not recommended, with a brief reason.

### Next steps / confirmation needed
Use numbered replies so approval is fast and unambiguous:
1. `1` — implement the full plan
2. `2 C1 C3` — implement selected item IDs only
3. `3 ...` — revise scope/order/details before implementation
4. `4` — do not make changes

A bare `2` is not enough; ask which item IDs to implement before editing.
```

If there are no substantive cleanup findings, say so clearly, list what you checked, and offer only optional improvements.

## Phase 6 — After approval

When the user approves implementation:

1. Restate the approved item IDs.
2. Make the smallest focused edits for those items.
3. Preserve existing conventions unless the approved change explicitly establishes a convention.
4. Avoid unrelated formatting churn.
5. Run each item's validation command when feasible.
6. Summarize changed files and verification results.

If approval is ambiguous, ask before editing.
